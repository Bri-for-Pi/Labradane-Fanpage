                   The first thing most people want to know is how they can be trained.

                Labradanes are fairly easy to train, they don't need as much time as other dogs do. </br></br>
                    I do reccomend training them as puppies, they are much easier then.</br>
                    Unless you want to train a 180 pound dog, then go right ahead.</br></br>
                    Another thing,
                    use positive reinforcement methods while training, and avoid from any harmful or
                    useless methods that could possibly ruin their love for you.</br> Since these sweet gentle
                    giants become very upset from just a slight bit of yelling.

                <p>
                 If you want to add this pup to your household as a guard dog, then it's best for you to pick another dog.</br> </br>
                 Considering this is one of the worst guard animals ever. </br> </br>
                 It may be a bit of a surprise because
                 of their large size. They are huge sweethearts that couldn't hurt a fly, well not on purpose at least.</br> </br>
                They are good watch dogs though; the Labradane will bark in order to alert you when an intruder is near or if something's
                not right.</br>
                But it's completely up to you to act, don't expect these cuties to do more than alerting.

                    <h1 id="size">How Big they'll get</h1>
                    <p>
                        Because both the parents are big dogs, the pup will be pretty large too. </br> </br>
                        Labradanes average weight is going to be around 100-190 lbs.</br> </br>
                        While it's height is going to be around 25-35 in tall.</br> </br>
                         You'll more than likely have to keep buying bigger and bigger beds even as a puppy,
                        expect a big pup.
                    </p>
                </br>

                        Both the Labrador and Great dane are gentle giants, huge sweethearts.</br>
                         They love receiving affection and giving love to it's owners,</br>
                        Both dogs adore cuddling and spending time with it's owner. They are perfect family dogs, but for older kids.</br>
                         The pupper could accidently
                        smother the smaller child because of it's huge size, and it doesn't realize how big they actually are.</br> </br>
                         As a puppy, they'll be very curious</br>
                        Since this puppies parents are one of the most affectionate breeds, I suggest this; </br>
                        Do not add this pup to your family if you don't have time to spend with it on a daily basis.</br> </br>
                         If you don't spend enough time with it, the poor pup will develop seperation anxiety and won't live a happy lifetime.

                <p>
                    First things first, DO NOT get this dog if you're wanting to keep it inside a small area like an apartment.</br> 
                    They won't be comfortable living in a small spaced house or apartment.</br> 
                </br> 
                A large backyard is the best thing for this giant dog</br> 
            </br> 
            For the weather, Labradane pups prefer moderate temperatures rather than extreme ones.</br> 
            Mostly because of it's short coats
                </p>
            </br>
        </br>
    </br>
</br>
                <h1 id="Care">Proper Care</h1>

                <p>
                    You want to first look at how much the dog sheds, and thankfully, it's low.</br>
                </br>
                You'll only have to worry about it's coat shedding a bit above average during <a href="http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/everything-you-need-to-know-about-fall-dog-shedding" target="_blank">Shedding Season</a>
            </br>
            Brushing this pup's coat about 1-2 times a week should keep it's coat nice and tidy.</br>
        </br>
        Bathing time is generally once every 2 weeks, but if the pupper really needs it, once a week.</br>
    </br>
        As for other grooming needs;</br>
    </br>
        Once every other day is the perfect time to brush their teeth,</br>
    </br>
        clean their ears around once every week,</br>
    </br>
        and trim nails whenever it grows longer than needed.</br>
